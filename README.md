# react-native-form-builder

A react native sample app, which shows how to build a helper component that would allow creating multiple forms by simply supplying a configuration object as a prop.

Try it out:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:vasilestefirta/react-native-form-builder.git
cd react-native-form-builder
npm install
react-native run-ios
```
